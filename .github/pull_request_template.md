## Schema Change Checklist (required if schema touched)

- [ ] I did not edit a frozen schema file (e.g., v1.md)
- [ ] I added a new schema version file (e.g., v2.md)
- [ ] I updated the schema changelog table in the new version file
- [ ] I added/updated a golden fixture in testdata/events/
- [ ] I documented migration strategy (even if "none needed")
